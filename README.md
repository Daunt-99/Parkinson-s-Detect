# 🧠 Parkinson's Detect

🎉 **2nd Place Winner** – AIMD Spring 2025 Presentation Night

A voice-based machine learning system that detects early signs of Parkinson’s Disease by analyzing vocal biomarkers with over **85% accuracy**. Built as part of a semester-long project at UTD, this tool leverages advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to aid early diagnosis.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Parkinson's Detect uses patients' voice recordings to extract key vocal features such as:
- **Pitch variations**
- **Jitter**
- **Shimmer**
- **Tremor indices**

These features are then processed through a robust ML pipeline using:
- ✅ **Random Forest**
- ✅ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Our system provides a non-invasive, accessible way to screen for Parkinson’s symptoms — with potential real-world impact in clinical pre-screening tools.
